# weatherapp
A website displaying weather informations from all around the world built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Please note that I am a self-taught beginner developper at this point, and that this project certainely has flaws. 
Feel free to send me your thoughts, I am here to learn :) 

## What is it ?
Here is a website that can be used to have informations about weather all aroud the world. 
After entering a city name, the website displays the name of the resquested location, a logo and a short text for sky description, the temperature, air humidity and wind speed.
All of that without refreshing the page thanks to AJAX.
The design is fully responsive to be displayed on computer screens, tablets and mobile.

I used the free OpenWeather API to have access to all the weather datas.

## Why ? 
The goal for me was to put in practice what I was learning about front-end web developement.
This project helped me to understand how to use an API, asyncronous JavaScript and XML(AJAX) and how to handle request with fetch().
